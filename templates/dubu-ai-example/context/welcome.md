# Welcome to Dubu

This is your personal context folder. Any `.md` files here will be loaded automatically when Dubu starts up.

## What to put here

- Personal preferences and working style
- Project context and background information
- Frequently referenced information
- Anything you want Dubu to remember across sessions

## Example Files

Create files like:
- `preferences.md` - Your communication preferences, timezone, etc.
- `projects.md` - Current projects you're working on
- `team.md` - Team members and their roles
- `tech-stack.md` - Technologies and tools you commonly use

## Tips

- Keep files focused on specific topics
- Update context as things change
- Dubu will synthesize all context files together
