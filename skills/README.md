# Skills

Custom skills and workflows for Dubu.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are reusable workflows or capabilities that can be added to Dubu. Unlike agents (which are personas), skills are specific actions or processes that any mode can use.

## Planned Skills

This folder is reserved for future skill definitions. Examples might include:

- **Code review** — Structured code review workflow
- **Git workflow** — Commit, PR, and merge helpers
- **Research** — Multi-source research and summarization
- **Refactoring** — Code refactoring patterns

## Creating a Skill

Add a `.md` file describing:

1. **Purpose** — What the skill accomplishes
2. **Trigger** — How to invoke it
3. **Steps** — The workflow or process
4. **Output** — What it produces
