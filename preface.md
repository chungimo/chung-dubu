# Preface

Technology always expands and reshapes the playing field. Nothing stays fixed. Even as more people get access to AI, “vibe coding,” MCPs, automations, and whatever the next wave of tooling is, it doesn’t make the work simpler long-term. It just makes everything faster and adds new layers of complexity.

Can more people step into a “developer role” now? Yeah, absolutely. But we’ve *always* had tools that lowered the barrier for beginners. That part isn’t new. What’s new is the pace and the leverage.

## What AI Actually Unlocks

The whole “vibe coding” narrative misses the point. The biggest shift isn’t beginners building apps — it’s what AI enables for experienced builders.

For devs who were burning hours on repetitive setup work, this is a cheat code. Instead of rebuilding the same auth flow, wiring the same patterns, and re-implementing the same scaffolding for the hundredth time, you can spend your energy on harder problems: product decisions, system design, edge cases, and iteration speed.

Offloading the grunt work you just can’t bring yourself to do again is a massive productivity boost.

And there isn’t really a skill ceiling on “using AI tools.” The ceiling is still the same as it always was: designing the parts of the system that are actually hard — the parts the AI tools are still struggle to design and implement cleanly.

## The Skill Gap Isn’t Going Away Entirely

AI isn’t replacing engineers overnight. What it’s doing is compressing the gap between idea and execution. The people who adapt fastest are going to lap everyone else.

But a lot of people aren’t going to use these tools well. They’ll ask questions, but they won’t know the *right* questions to ask. They won’t have the context to spot the bad assumptions, or understand why a solution is fragile, insecure, or just plain wrong under the hood.

Google has been around for decades and a surprising number of people still never learned how to efficiently use it. AI will be the same. That’s why there’s still a ton of value in being the middleman — the person who can translate intent into correct execution.

## Using AI Without Getting Burned

AI tools are extremely valuable for experienced engineers. They’re great for brainstorming, speeding up development, and boosting productivity. But using them effectively still requires strong fundamentals.

You have to be able to clearly articulate what you’re trying to accomplish at a technical level. Without that, the result might look fine on the surface, but it’ll be brittle, insecure, or poorly designed where it matters.

Building a complete product solely with AI, without real engineering oversight, in a production environment is will be either unrealistic or a risk you’re eventually going to pay for.
